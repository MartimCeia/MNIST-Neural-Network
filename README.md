**MNIST NEURAL NETWORK**

This code builds and trains a simple neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It splits the dataset into training and validation sets, and then initializes the network's weights and biases. The network learns by repeatedly processing the training data, adjusting its parameters to minimize errors, and stopping early if performance on the validation set stops improving. It also generates a plot showing how the validation loss changed during training. Finally, it evaluates the network's accuracy on the validation set and displays a few example predictions of random datasets along with the corresponding images.
